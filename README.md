# Blue Steel Unofficial Update
### _Updated to work with jQuery 3.6_

> `This plugin was originally developed by Tejas Ambani.`
> Original plugin [on PowerSource](https://support.powerschool.com/exchange/view.action?download.id=749)
> `This plugin comes as is. Please test it on a Test server before putting it live.`

I updated the plugin for our school's personal needs. The only files modified were:
- web_root/admin/bscpm/home.html
- web_root/admin/bscpm/directory.html

## Installation:
To install, replace the two files mentioned above (`home.html` & `directory.html`) using the built in Custom Page Manager (url: `https://yourschoolPS.com/admin/customization/home.html`).

## Original list of features from PowerSource:
**Make sure you have access to the stock CPM before using.**
A new more functional version of Custom Page Management (CPM). 
This was created to have a better interface to CPM and make it easier to customize.
